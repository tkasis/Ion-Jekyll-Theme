                <h4>Site Creation Solutions</h4>
                <p>I recommend and prefer to design and install Content Management Systems (CMS). This makes it easy for you to update your content without the future need of a webmaster.</p>
                <p>I like building sites with Open Source tools. There are several options available but I have the most experience with <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and <a href="https://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. These platforms have a lot of user contributed free or inexpensive extensions readily available so major functionality can be implemented quite easily. All platforms use templates for display so complete visual makeovers are relatively simple to accomplish, thus if in the future you tire of the look of your site, we change it.</p>
                <h4>Creativity and Display</h4>
                <p>I enjoy building simple, elegant, accessible sites. All important information is within a few clicks and accessible to visitors with disabilities. You tell me the tone and feel you are looking for and I will work with you to get a nice looking site.</p>
                <h4>How this works</h4>
                <p>I build the site and teach you how to change your content, giving you limited, safe access to the administrator section. After you learn how to maintain your site, I expand your access permissions access so that you can install and change extensions and other features of your system. You will be amazed at how much power and ease of use you will have.</p>
                <p>If your site needs are simple, prefer a hands off experience and only require a static presence, I can build you a site with the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static site generator.</p>
