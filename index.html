						<p>Tom Kraft Design creates and maintains websites using open source platforms. Specifically the content management systems <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. Because I use open source applications, when you have a site built or rebuilt by me you are the owner of all aspects of your site, unlike many designer and developers that use proprietary or home grown applications that offer little configurability with restrictive license schemes. This offers my clients flexibility and expandability with their sites. Though anyone can download and install these open source applications, I have the experience needed to develop a site to customer specifications and teach them how to manage it. Using the latest technologies and building with current web standards I am able to create some attractive, clean, accessible sites.</p><p>If you are interested in an affordable, attractive web presence, allow me to give you some ideas and a quote. If you are unhappy with your existing site, maybe I could make you happy with a rebuild.</p><p>Take a few minutes to review my <a href="/projects">projects</a> and the <a href="/what-i-do">services</a> I provide to see if Tom Kraft Design would be the solution for you. If you want to know a little bit more about me, take a look at my <a href="/about-me">web development history</a>.</p>
