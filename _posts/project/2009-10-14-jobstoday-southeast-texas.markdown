JobsToday Southeast Texas is a job listing board site. The client, The Examiner Corporation, is located in Beaumont Texas. They needed a way to dynamically list all of their job listings and provide advertising for thier clients. Used Drupal 6 and it was the first time we created a custom theme using Drupal. Nice little greenscreen video diplayed using jQuery.

* Drupal 6
* Blueprint is the theme base
* Notable modules: CCK, Views, Ad
* FlowPlayer was used to play the video locally
