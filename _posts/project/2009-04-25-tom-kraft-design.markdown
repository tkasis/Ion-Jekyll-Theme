I first built Tom Kraft Design with Drupal 6 back in 2009. Because I really did not need any dynamic data rendering, I rebuilt it in August of 2016 using Jekyll. My first static production site. It is lickity fast.

Only took two days to build.

* Jekyll
* Skel framework for the built in responsiveness
* Projects posts are written in Markdown
* Used the Ion Jekyll Theme
