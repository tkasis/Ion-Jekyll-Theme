Charlie's Place Recovery Center is a treatment center and detoxification unit in Corpus Christi Texas. I was first contacted and hired to update and maintain an existing static site. Soon realized that it would be far more practical to create a CMS. Since the original scope was minimal, WordPress was chosen. They have since requested several functionality updates and in retrospect, Drupal would have been a better CMS choice.

* WordPress
* EcoBox theme
* Notable plugins: WooCommerce, PressPremit for additional access controls, all my favorites, and a slew of minor players
