Linda’s Drapery & Interiors is in Corpus Christi Texas. Wendi, the owner, provides window coverings and decorating services to her clients. I took her old static site and rebuilt it using WordPress. WordPress was chosen because of simple site requirements with photo display as the main focus. And there are a lot of classy premium themes that would easily fulfill this requirement. Since 2010 the site has gone through 2 facelifts. We use the barter system and we trade web development for home decorating services.

* WordPress
* All my favorite plugins
* X premium theme from Themeco
