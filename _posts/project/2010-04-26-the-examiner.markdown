The Examiner is a weekly newspaper out of Beaumont Texas. It is owned by The Examiner Corporation. They had an existing custom site but wanted a face lift. We used Drupal 6 because Drupal 7 was not yet ready. This is a wonderfully complex site using views and relying heavily on taxonomy.

* Drupal 6
* City Magazine news/magazine premium theme using Fusion base theme
* Notable modules: Views, Taxonomy, Ubercart for subscriptions, Advertisement
